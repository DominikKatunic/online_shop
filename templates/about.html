        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            This online shop project was developed using a combination of modern web technologies. 
            The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience. 
            For the backend, Python and SQLite were used to manage data and business logic efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system includes functionalities such as user authentication, product management, 
            shopping cart handling, and order processing. Additionally, an admin panel is available 
            for managing users and monitoring sales. The database model is structured to support 
            scalability and maintainability.
